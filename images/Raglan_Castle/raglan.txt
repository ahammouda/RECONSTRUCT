This CD contains 46 uncompressed TIFF-format files of photographs of
the main keep at Raglan castle.

Raglan castle keep is an unusual hexagonal structure in the French style.
All of one face and half of two adjascent faces were destroyed by Oliver
Cromwell, leaving the interior of the keep visible from the open side.  The
keep stands on a hexagonal base surrounded by a water-filled moat.

I tried to record every feature of the exterior of the keep, from moat
to roof-line, plus most of the interior, in at least 3 images shot
from diff views.  The lens focal length was freely changed between shots.
Two rolls of film of different speeds were used and the camera (or operator!)
unfortunately did not match the exposures of the 2 films as well as they
might have been.

The separated parts of each file name are intended to provide a
(perhaps unnecessary) key to each shot:

1) "moat", "lawn", "roof" - describes, in increasing height, the general level
   and distance from the keep at which each group of shots was taken.
2) a number indictes the very approximate (+-10 degrees) bearing from the centre
   of the keep to the camera location.
3) "tower" or "interior" indicates whether or not the shot was exterior
4) the faces of the keep are numbered 1-6 in a clockwise (from above) order.
   Face 1 is the first face clockwise from the drawbridge.  Face 2 is partly
   destroyed.  Face 3 is completely destroyed.  Face 4 is partly destroyed.
   Face 5 is intact, and face 6 has the main gateway and bridge.
   "full", "upper", and "lower" and the face number(s) indicate the general
   content of the shot.  An "L" or "R" suffix to the face number indicates
   if only its left or right part is in view.
5) where there are "stereo pairs" of almost exactly the same view, shot on a
   short baseline, these are indicated "p" and "q"
6) if the bridge was significantly in view, this is indicated.

Good luck!
